üåä Flood Monitoring and Early Warning System
This project is an IoT-based flood monitoring and early warning system designed to help communities stay informed and prepared for potential flooding events. Using real-time sensor data, cloud integration, and alert mechanisms, the system offers intelligent flood detection and timely notifications.


üîß Features
Water Level Detection using Ultrasonic Sensors

Real-time Data Upload to ThingSpeak

Temperature & Humidity Monitoring via DHT22 sensor

Motion Sensing (PIR) to detect human presence in flood zones

Alert Mechanisms using buzzers and LEDs

Mobile App Interface built with Python & Kivy

Web Dashboard for visualization of flood data

Email/SMS Alerts via services like Twilio (optional)

Google Maps Integration to show sensor locations

Cloud Backend using HTTP/MQTT and ThingSpeak API


üì± Mobile App (Kivy-Based)
The mobile app displays real-time sensor data fetched from the backend. Users can:

View water level and weather data

Press a button to refresh current readings

Connect via secure API endpoints



üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Microcontrollers: ESP32 or similar

Sensors: DHT22, HC-SR04, PIR

Cloud: ThingSpeak, Google Cloud (optional), Flask API

Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS (Dashboard), Kivy (Mobile App)

Backend: Python (Flask) with SQLite or Firebase

Communication: HTTP requests via urequests

Wi-Fi Integration: Onboard ESP32 network modules


üîÑ Data Flow
Sensors capture environmental data.

ESP32 processes the input and transmits it to ThingSpeak using HTTP.

ThingSpeak stores and visualizes the data.

Mobile App / Web Dashboard fetches and displays the latest data.

Optional alerts are triggered if thresholds are crossed.


üìä Circuit Diagram & Code
Full circuit uses ESP32, Ultrasonic sensor, DHT22, PIR sensor, Buzzer, and LEDs.

Includes complete MicroPython code with ThingSpeak integration.

Upload via Arduino IDE or Thonny for MicroPython boards.


‚úÖ Future Improvements
Add push notifications for emergency alerts

Implement SMS alerts via Twilio API
